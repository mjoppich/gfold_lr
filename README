1. To compile the program you need to install GNU gsl library
   first. If you cannot install GSL in the standard library, you might
   execute the following commands:

   export CXXFLAGS="-g -O3 -I/your/installed/path/include -L/your/installed/path/lib" 
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/your/installed/path/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

   in which /your/installed/path/ is the path where you install
   GSL. The first one is for compiling and the second one is for
   running gfold. It is suggested that the second command is added to
   the .bashrc or .bash_profile file in the home directory.

2. Compile the program by running command "make"

3. The executable program is "gfold" with documentation in directory "doc"
