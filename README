VERSIONS:
V1.0.6. A more comprehensive installation instruction is added. GTF format is
set to default. RPKM is added in the 'count' output.

V1.0.5. GTF format for the gene annotation is supported.

V1.0.4. When no replicate is available, calculate GFOLD accurately instead of
using MCMC. This version also calculates RPKM of each gene and removes some
useless columns in the output of the previous version.

V1.0.2. The first released version, which generates the results of the paper.

INSTALLATION
1. To compile the program you need to install GNU gsl library
   first. If you cannot install GSL in the standard library, you need to
   execute the following commands:

   export CXXFLAGS="-g -O3 -I/your/installed/path/include -L/your/installed/path/lib" 
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/your/installed/path/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

   in which /your/installed/path/ is the path where you install
   GSL. The first one is for compiling and the second one is for running gfold.
   It is suggested that the second command is added to the .bashrc (for Linux)
   or .bash_profile (for MacOS) file in the home directory. If you added these
   two lines, then please execute the following command to reload you config
   file

   source ~/.bash_profile        # If you are using MacOS
   source ~/.bashrc              # If you are using Linux
   
   To check whether your setting is correct, you can execute the 
   following command in the terminal

   echo $CXXFLAGS

   If the output is empty then some steps above are not correctly followed.
   If the output is not empty, then the output should be a directory. Check
   the existence of this directory and make sure that there is a 'gsl' fold
   in this directory.
                              
2. Compile the program by running command "make". If GSL libraray is not set correctly, 
   errors as the following would occur.
                              
   g++ -O3 -Wall -lgsl -lgslcblas -g main.cc -o gfold
   In file included from GeneInfo.hpp:29,
                    from main.cc:24:
   Utility.hpp:69:36: error: gsl/gsl_statistics_int.h: No such file or directory
   Utility.hpp:70:28: error: gsl/gsl_vector.h: No such file or directory
   ...

   If it happens, please following step 1 again. If error remains, please try the following command:

   g++ -O3 -Wall -lgsl -lgslcblas -g main.cc -o gfold -I/your/installed/path/include -L/your/installed/path/lib

3. The executable program is "gfold" with documentation in directory "doc"
