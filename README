1. To compile the program you need to install GNU gsl library
   first. If you cannot install GSL in the standard library, you might
   execute the following commands:

   export CXXFLAGS="-g -O3 -I/your/installed/path/include -L/your/installed/path/lib" 
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/your/installed/path/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

   in which /your/installed/path/ is the path where you install
   GSL. The first one is for compiling and the second one is for
   running gfold. It is suggested that the second command is added to
   the .bashrc or .bash_profile file in the home directory. If you
   added these two lines, then please execute the following command
   to reload you config file

   source ~/.bash_profile        # If you are using MacOS
   source ~/.bash_rc             # If you are using Linux
   
   To check whether your setting is correct, you can execute the 
   following command in the terminal

   echo $CXXFLAGS

   If the output is empty then some steps above are not correctly followed.
   If the output is not empty, then the output should be a directory. Check
   the existence of this directory and make sure that there is a 'gsl' fold
   in this directory.
                              
2. Compile the program by run ning command "make". If GSL libraray is not set correctly, 
   errors as the following would occur.
                              
   g++ -O3 -Wall -lgsl -lgslcblas -g main.cc -o gfold
   In file included from GeneInfo.hpp:29,
                    from main.cc:24:
   Utility.hpp:69:36: error: gsl/gsl_statistics_int.h: No such file or directory
   Utility.hpp:70:28: error: gsl/gsl_vector.h: No such file or directory
   ...

   If it happens, please following step 1 again. If error remains, please try the following command:

   g++ -O3 -Wall -lgsl -lgslcblas -g main.cc -o gfold -I/your/installed/path/include

3. The executable program is "gfold" with documentation in directory "doc"
