<p>gfold - Generalized fold change for ranking differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data.</p>

<p>GFOLD is especially useful when no replicate is available. GFOLD generalizes the fold change by considering the posterior distribution of log fold change, such that each gene is assigned a reliable fold change. It overcomes the shortcoming of p-value that measures the significance of whether a gene is differentially expressed under different conditions instead of measuring relative expression changes, which are more interesting in many studies. It also overcomes the shortcoming of fold change that suffers from the fact that the fold change of genes with low read count are not so reliable as that of genes with high read count, even these two genes show the same fold change.</p>

<p>Given the gene annotation in GTF/GPF/BED format and mapped short reads in SAM/BED format, count the number of reads mapped to each gene. Because of possible overlapping of multiple genes, a read could be mapped to the overlaped region of multiple genes. In this case, a read is counted multiple times with each time for each gene. Furthermore, if a gene is on multiple chromosomes or different strands of the same chromosome, only exons on one strand of one chromosome (the one appear first in the annotation file) will be assigned to this gene. Exons not on this strand of the chromosome will be discarded.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="diff"><b>diff</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>For each gene, calculate GFOLD value and other statistics. <b>diff</b> accepts the output of <b>count</b> as the input. Please refer to the output format of <b>count</b> for more information about the input format. If you are not satisfied with the strategy adopted by <b>count</b>, you can generate gene read counts by yourself. In the input for <b>diff</b> &#39;GeneSymbol&#39; and &#39;Read Count&#39; are critical. If you fake &#39;Gene exon length&#39;, the RPKM calculated will not be valid. You can fake other columns to make gfold run. Further more the order of gene names should be the same for different samples. The 4th column of the output of <b>count</b> (gene length) only influences the RPKM in the output of <b>diff</b>. If it is missing, RPKM will not be generated by <b>diff</b>. <b>diff</b> does not use the 5th column of the output of <b>count</b>.</p>

<dd>

<p>GFOLD value for every gene. The GFOLD value could be considered as a reliable log2 fold change. It is positive/negative if the gene is up/down regulated. The main usefulness of GFOLD is to provide a biological meanlingful ranking of the genes. The GFOLD value is zero if the gene doesn&#39;t show differential expression. If the log2 fold change is treated as a random variable, a positive GFOLD value x means that the probability of the log2 fold change (2nd/1st) being larger than x is (1 - the parameter specified by <b>-sc</b>); A negative GFOLD value x means that the probability of the log2 fold change (2st/1nd) being smaller than x is (1 - the parameter specified by <b>-sc</b>). If this file is sorted by this column in descending order then genes ranked at the top are differentially up-regulated and genes ranked at the bottom are differentially down-regulated. Note that a gene with GFOLD value 0 should never be considered differentially expressed. However, it doesn&#39;t mean that all genes with non-negative GFOLD value are differentially expressed. For taking top differentially expressed genes, the user is responsible for selecting the cutoff.</p>

<dd>

<p>The RPKM for the first condition. It is available only if gene length is available. If multiple replicates are available, the RPKM is calculated simply by summing over replicates.
